- **Introduction :** With the advancement of technology, application areas of computer are rising day by day. Every sector desires its procurement for fast accurate and automated operations. Therefore, different program is developed to meet the requirement of various types of users i.e. related to any field.                                 <br />                                                  
This program entitled “School Management System” is a minor group work of B.E.Computer IVth semester students. It is a small software package which is helpful in the areas of School. This program package includes all the activities in which the school is managed. The activities like school admission, simple transactions like class fee payments and employee salary, exporting data into MS excel, report generating etc. are included.                  <br /> <br />
This project is database oriented program because it is developed using DBMS like MS SQL server. We have used SQL connection objects for Database programming in this project. The programming language used for developing this software is C# .NET.Users can simply add record, delete them, update them, create Backups of the Database, and many more using this software. User need not have to think about where the data should be saved or from where we can retrieve it. All the data are saved automatically in the defined place and are retrieved from there directly by using this software. No computer trainings or experts are needed to handle this software.
In terms of security this software is totally secure as it doesn't give access to unauthorized users as the username and password facility is provided.                       <br /> <br /> Hence, this software is helpful for the School Managerial teams who want to improve the efficiency of the management and want to be competitive in this day to day changing world. This project is also a small step towards development of big professional software.
